# Simple-Password-Encryptor-and-Decryptor
This program can take in a password and encrypts it. It can also take in an encrypted password (that was encrypted by this program) and decrypt it.

In order to run this program it is only necessary to instal Python install python on your machine. Then you can simply run the password_script.py file and it will prompt you to pick between encrypting or decrypting a password.

Warning: This tool is for educational use only and should not be used for securing sensitive information.

Ethical Considerations: This program might give a false sense of security to some users. It is not a professional password encryptor by any means. I did for a university assignment. Do not think that the encrypted password is completely secure. Furthermore, if you know someone that has used this program to encrypt their password and you find out what that encryption is, it would be ethically wrong to try and decrypt their password. That is not the purpose of this program.
